            Hello and welcome to the Gecko Cave. This is a place where you can learn about geckos and how to care for them. Thank you for visiting our site to further your gargoyle gecko knowlage.

            One of the great things about gargoyles geckos are that they are very easy to care for and are very friendly. They are a great pet for anyone who is looking for a low maintenance pet.

            I am currently working on this site so please be patient with me. I am trying to make this site as user friendly as possible. I have just started my bachelor's degree in game programming and I am trying to learn as much as I can about web development.
