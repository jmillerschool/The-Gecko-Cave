                        <li><strong>DIY Delight:</strong> Whip up a magical mix of 60% organic topsoil and 40% peat moss—voilà, you’re a substrate wizard!</li>
                        <li><strong>Cozy Natural Bedding:</strong> The snuggliest natural reptile bedding around.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reptile Soil:</strong> Because your scaly friend deserves a five-star spa treatment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bioactive Kit:</strong> For those who want to throw a wild party in their terrarium!</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
        
                <h3>Layer Up!</h3>
                <p class = "subst" >Put down 2-4 inches of your substrate masterpiece to keep things cozy and humid. Think of it as a fluffy mattress for your reptile friend! Remember to give it a daily tidying and a full makeover every month. For top-tier results, add a drainage layer like hydro balls or a moisture retention layer to keep things from getting soggy—nobody likes a swampy home!</p>
        
                <p class = "subst">I’m a big fan of natural substrates because they hold onto moisture like a squirrel hoarding nuts for winter, and they look super pretty too! But watch out—these loose particles can be tricky for tiny critters under 13g. Ingesting them might lead to a bit of a tummy ache!</p>
        
                <div class ="box2">
                    <h3>Bioactive Bliss!</h3>
                    <p class = "subst">If you want to take it up a notch, bioactive substrates are the way to go! They create a fantastic team-up between your gargoyle gecko, some happy plants, and little cleanup crew critters that love to munch on waste. It’s like having your own self-cleaning terrarium—magic!</p>

Switching to paper towels has made it possible for me to finally have pets without sneezing my head off.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shop Towels:</strong> Because every reptile deserves a splash of color!</li>

                    <h3>Bad Substrates: The No-Gos!</h3>
                    <p class = "subst" >Now, let's talk about the “bad apples” of the substrate world! Some keepers say loose substrates should be avoided like the plague, fearing impaction for geckos of all sizes. But fear not! As long as you’re on top of your husbandry game, substrate impaction isn’t a big worry for most. Larger geckos are like little champions and can handle swallowing a few stray particles just fine!</p>
                    
                    <h3>Watch Out For:</h3>

                        <li><strong>Large-Particle Beddings:</strong> Like chunky bark—yikes! The impaction risk is real here.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wood-Based Substrates:</strong> These guys can contain harmful compounds. No thanks!</li>
                        <li><strong>Carpet Substrates:</strong> Looks cool, but those pesky fibers can snag and hurt delicate gecko toes—ouch!</li>
                        <li><strong>Coconut Fiber:</strong> This stuff expands in the stomach like a balloon—definitely not what we want!</li>

                <div class="boxLight">
                    <h3>Let There Be Light!</h3>
                    <p>First things first—gargoyle geckos aren’t exactly fans of blinding sunbaths. Think of them as the introverts of the reptile world. They prefer a cozy, dimly lit atmosphere, like a comfy café on a rainy day!</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="boxLight2">
                    <h3>UVB Rays: A Splash of Sunshine!</h3>
                    <p>Even though they love the shade, our scaly friends still need a sprinkle of UVB light! This magical sunshine helps them absorb calcium and stay healthy. Aim for a low-output UVB bulb, positioned about 12-18 inches above their habitat—just enough to give them a sun-kissed glow without overdoing it!</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="boxLight">
                    <h3>Daylight & Nighttime: The Perfect Balance!</h3>
                    <p>Keep the lighting on for about 10-12 hours a day, mimicking the natural cycle of day and night. But when the sun sets, it’s time for a cozy night light! Use a gentle, red or blue bulb to help them navigate their world without blinding them—think of it as their own nighttime disco!</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="boxLight2">
                    <h3>Heat: Warm and Toasty!</h3>
                    <p>While they don’t need a sauna, gargoyle geckos enjoy a nice warm spot in their habitat. A basking area should be around 80-85°F (27-29°C). This warmth helps them digest their food and feel all snuggly inside. Use a heat mat or basking bulb, but remember, no scorching hot spots—these geckos like it cozy!</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="boxLight">
                    <h3>Keeping it Cozy!</h3>
                    <p>Lastly, always monitor the temperatures and humidity levels. Use a thermometer and hygrometer to keep an eye on your gecko’s environment. After all, nobody wants a cranky gecko throwing a hissy fit because it’s too hot or too cold!</p>

                    <p>Feed your gargoyle gecko about 2-3 times a week, offering a mix of gecko food and insects. Make sure to provide fresh food and remove any leftovers to keep their home clean and tidy. A happy gecko is a well-fed gecko!</p>

                <div class="boxCare">
                    <h3>Handling Preferences</h3>
                    <p>Gargoyle geckos are known for their unique personalities! While many prefer not to be held, some can be quite friendly and may seek short moments of interaction. It's important to recognize each gecko's comfort level.</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="boxCare2">
                    <h3>Short Snuggles</h3>
                    <p>If your gargoyle gecko enjoys being held, keep it brief! A quick cuddle can be a delightful experience, but never force them to stay in your hands. Respect their boundaries to build trust.</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="boxCare">
                    <h3>Watch Out for Jumps!</h3>
                    <p>Be prepared for unexpected leaps! Gargoyle geckos are natural jumpers and may suddenly spring from your hands. Always handle them in a safe environment to avoid accidents.</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="boxCare2">
                    <h3>Creating a Safe Space</h3>
                    <p>When handling your gecko, make sure to provide a secure area. Low surfaces with soft landing spots are ideal. This helps prevent injuries if they decide to take a leap!</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="boxCare">
                    <h3>Building Trust Takes Time</h3>
                    <p>Spend time near your gecko's enclosure without reaching in. Allow them to observe you and get comfortable. With patience, many geckos will warm up to gentle handling over time!</p>
