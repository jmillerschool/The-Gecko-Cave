                <h2>Base Pattern</h2>
                <p>First up is the base pattern—think of it as their outfit. Whether they are rocking stripes like a tiny reptile tiger, sporting bold blotches like they are wearing gecko camo, or showing off snazzy bands, this is their "outfit" covering the body, especially down the back and sides. Its like the geckos personal runway from head to tail. You will spot these patterns strutting across their whole body, even down to their legs and tail. Stylish from head to toe (or tail!). The base pattern of our delightful gargoyle geckos is like their very own mood ring! Generally dressed in a stunning black or dark brown, these little creatures show off their colors in different ways, depending on how fired up they are. When they're feeling extra vibrant, their pigments shine at their brightest, but when they are more relaxed, those colors can become muted or even vanish. We love to categorize these patterns into two main groups: Striped and Reticulated, with some fabulous variations like Super Stripe, Banded, Mosaic, and Mottled!</p>
                                
                <div class="pattern">
                    <h3>Striped</h3>
                    <p>Stripes are like little fashion statements running down the length of our geckos bodies! These stripes can be solid or sport a fun, broken pattern, giving each gecko its own unique look. Even mottled patterns that resemble stripes can count! In our experience, stripes are often the more dominant trait, so they are quite the trendsetters in the gecko world. Just remember, not every gecko with color bars is a super stripe; we are focusing on the base patterns here!</p>

                <div class="pattern">
                    <h3>Super Stripe</h3>
                    <p>Now, lets talk about the Super Stripe—these geckos are the stars of the show! They flaunt their stripes all over, including their limbs and tails, creating a dazzling display. While their stripes might have a little bit of flair and be slightly broken, they still look fabulous. A super stripe usually boasts four to six sets of these stunning patterns, with a bold dorsal stripe running along the tail. But, just to clarify, the thickness of the mid-dorsal stripe is not the only thing that qualifies a gecko as a super stripe!</p>

                <div class="pattern">
                    <h3>Reticulated</h3>
                    <p>The Reticulated pattern is all about artistic flair! Picture a canvas of random, beautifully abstract designs spreading across the geckos body. The markings are varied, without any strict rules, giving each gecko its own special look. This pattern is reminiscent of the “wild type” style that was once quite common, but nowadays, striped beauties are also making their mark!</p>

                <div class="pattern">
                    <h3>Banded</h3>
                    <p>Next up is the Banded pattern! Think of it as a stylish remix of the reticulated look, where bands create a bit of predictable magic over the top. These bands usually start from the midpoint on the back and gracefully cascade down the sides. If the pattern remains cohesive, it is still classified as banded. We also love to call particularly clean banded geckos “alterna,” named after the gorgeous Gray-Banded Kingsnake!</p>
                    <div class="scroll-container">

                <div class="pattern">
                    <h3>Mosaic</h3>
                    <p>Now for something extra special—the Mosaic pattern! This rare beauty combines elements of stripes and reticulated patterns in the most whimsical way. Picture bold markings dancing randomly across the gecko, creating a delightful visual surprise. Mosaics can be found more frequently in stripe-based geckos, but they can also pop up in reticulated ones. We are excited to see more mosaic hatchlings as we breed these enchanting creatures!!</p>
                    <div class="scroll-container">
                        <img src="mosaic1.jpg" alt="Mosaic Example 1">

                </div>
    
                <div class="pattern">
                    <h3>Mottled</h3>
                    <p>the Mottled pattern, a charming blend that leans toward a reticulated look but maintains a bit of uniformity. It is not quite full banding, but it is also not completely random—think of it as the shy cousin of the banded pattern! With synonyms like streaked, marbled, dappled, stippled, and flecked, this pattern adds a touch of elegance to the mix. Though we have not spotted many strong examples, each one is a true gem!</p>
                    <div class="scroll-container">
                        <img src="mottled1.jpg" alt="Mottled Example 1">

                </div>

                <div class="pattern">
                    <h3>Blotch</h3>
                    <p>Blotch, blotch, hooray! This pattern features fun patches of color over a reticulated or banded base. It is like a splash of paint on a masterpiece! The splotches follow the base patterns—like a canvas of color swirls, especially on banded geckos. On striped critters, it is more like partial bars trying to join the fun. Each blotch tells a story, and every gecko is a work of art!</p>
                    <div class="scroll-container">

                <div class="pattern">
                    <h3>Super Blotch</h3>
                    <p>Super Blotch to the rescue! This bold pattern takes blotching to the next level, covering a bigger portion of our fabulous geckos. The excitement builds as these color patches expand, creating a vivid spectacle. While there is no set percentage, one thing's for sure: these guys get even more colorful as they grow up, making them the ultimate show-stoppers in any terrarium!</p>
                    <div class="scroll-container">

                    <h3>Dorsal Blotching & Skeleton</h3>
                    <p>Get ready for some dorsal drama! This cool pattern features a stripe of blotching that follows the spine, giving our geckos a unique flair. Think of it as a funky hairstyle that everyone admires! When combined with color banding, I affectionately refer to this combo as “skeleton.” It is like Halloween for your gecko—spook-tacular and ready to party! </p>

                <h3>Pattern Color</h3>
                <div class = "description">
                    Lets dive into the dazzling world of gargoyle gecko colors, where every little scaly buddy has its own unique hue! Imagine these cuties as living mood rings—when they are fired up, their colors shine like a disco ball at a dance party, and when they are chilling, they might tone it down to something more subtle. But here is the twist: whether they are vibrant or mellow, those colors are always there, just waiting to strut their stuff! 
                    <br>
                    Now, for the stripe lovers out there, we have got three fabulous locations where colors like to hang out, known as bars! First up, the dorsal bar, which cozies up along the spine—like a fashionable belt! Next, we have the side bar, slightly more laid back, lounging a bit away from the spine but still making a statement. And lets not forget the lateral bar, proudly displayed on the side, often called the “lats” because, hey, why not give it a nickname?
                </div>

                    <h3>Red</h3>
                    <div class="description">
                        Welcome to the red carpet! This color pattern boasts shades ranging from light cherry to dark blood-red—think of it as the classic red dress of the gargoyle world. Red is the most common hue you'll find strutting its stuff! These fiery geckos often steal the spotlight, making everyone wonder if they are born to be stars or just really good at posing.

                        Say hello to the zesty orange! This lively color shines brightest when paired with a yellow background, creating a sunny disposition thats sure to brighten anyones day. Picture your gecko as a little citrus fruit—vibrant, cheerful, and totally not a red wannabe! Orange geckos bring the sunshine, even on cloudy days.

                    <div class="description">
                        Now we are cooking with gas! Some geckos show off both red and orange colors, strutting their stuff in three distinct zones—dorsal, side, and lateral. While babies might flip-flop between the two as they mature, adults rocking this combo are often dubbed “bacon” geckos! The ultimate brunch special! And just for fun, I have got one special guy, Takis, who flips the script with “reverse bacon.” Now that is some tasty color!

                    <div class="description">
                        The elusive white! Mostly seen on striped geckos, this rare gem glows like a beacon when the gecko is fired up. In darker geckos, it often hangs out as a solid side bar, looking like a fashionable accessory. However, the big mystery remains: will it stick around as the gecko matures, or will it phase out like a pop star's one-hit wonder? Only time will tell!

While it might not be as common as red, yellow is a showstopper in its own right, bringing a pop of color to the party. And when paired with a red dorsal bar? It is like a tropical sunset in your terrarium!

                <p>
                    Lets dive into the fabulous world of background colors! Think of the background color as the geckos daily outfit choice—sometimes subtle, sometimes fierce, and always mood-dependent. When they are “fired up,” it is like they are ready to hit the red carpet; when they are “fired down,” they are in full chill mode.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        The drama queen of backgrounds! When fired up, these geckos rock a bold red look that screams confidence. When they are feeling a little more low-key, they turn a gentle pink. Dont expect this dramatic flair to show up until they are about 6-10 months old though—it is a slow burn. From rusty reds to deep crimson, theres a whole range of red variants. And if its too rusty, it is more of a “red with a twist of brown” than a true red. But hey, every gecko has its own style!

                    <p>
                        Pink is like reds more delicate cousin. These geckos keep it soft and sweet—firing down into a pale pink or near-white and only managing a light pink even when fully fired up. Dont expect these little guys to go red though—they are true to their soft pink vibes, and their red eye-rings add just the right pop of color. Not everyone is into pink, but the ones who are? Absolutely fabulous.

                    <p>
                        Orange background geckos are like the wildcards of the group. They are rare, but they shine bright! People often confuse them with red, but a quick look at their belly will reveal their true citrusy nature. They are like geckos with a permanent sunset glow.

                    <p>
                        Yellow geckos are sneaky—they look their best when they are chilling out. When fired down, their yellow is bright and sunny, but when fired up? They sometimes blend in with shades of brown, like they have just come back from a muddy adventure. Still, when fully grown, they are a sight to behold—like a tiny, walking ray of sunshine!

                    <p>
                        The true black-and-white beauties are the rarest of the bunch. When fired up, they are crisp and clear—black patterns on a white background. But when they fire down, they turn all ghostly, like they have faded into the mist! If theres even a hint of brown in the mix when fired up, sorry, no ghost status for you!

                    <h3>Brown</h3>
                    <p>
                        Brown backgrounds are like the geckos comfy sweater—common, cozy, and not always the star of the show. These geckos often have a hint of yellow when fired down, but when fired up, they are rocking that earthy, warm brown. Sometimes, there is a hint of rusty red, but make no mistake—it is more brown than red. They might not be the most flashy, but hey, every gecko has its charm!
